## BT Indices Demo

These bash files provide a demonstration of the BT indices generation process, how the resulting CtC indices and PV indices can be deployed in an exploratory setting, the results of the statistical query generation process and the corresponding experiments.<br>
Initially, put all bash files into the directory where the RDF dump file is located (in the current directory should be a "swdf.ttl" file). Start with "ctcIndicesGenerator.sh" in order to generate the HDT file and the CtC indices. Afterwards, generate the PV indices with "pvIndicesGenerator.sh".<br>
In order to start an exploration, execute "catExplorationDemo.sh" to see how the CtC indices can be deployed in practice. For the demonstration of the PV indices in an exploratory setting, execute the bash file "pvExplorationDemo.sh".<br>
After the PV and CtC indices have been generated, the file "queryGeneration.sh" can be deployed in order to automatically generate category, filter and hybrid queries from the corresponding HDT file. In turn, once the queries have been generated and reduced to a reasonable size, the query model objects are converted to the SPARQL query language in appropriate text files. By executing the experiment scripts, the queries from the corresponding directories are automatically deployed and the resulting time measurements are thus written to the respective query directory.
